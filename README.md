This project was partly inspired by Amazon's item-to-item collaborative filtering algorithm that recommends to users what 'customers who bought this item
also bought'. You can read more about this algorithm and how it works <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/Amazon-Recommendations.pdf">here</a> if
you are interested.

## Setting up the project locally

To install this project locally on your machine is pretty quick and straightforward:

1. clone this project
2. cd into the 'client' folder and run 'npm install' to install necessary dependencies.
3. cd into the 'server' folder and run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. This will install all python modules in the 'requirements.txt' file.
4. create a '.env' file in the 'server' folder and add all of the required environment variables. These can be found in the 'env_sample.txt' file.
5. This project uses Redis for rate limiting and caching API calls, meaning that you will need a redis instance storage URI in the .env file.
   If you do not want to do this, you will need to remove the 'limiter' object in the 'settings.py' file, the 'redis_client' object in the 'settings.py'
   file, and all of the decorators from the routes that use the 'limiter' object. Additionally, you will need to navigate to the 'Redis.py' file and
   remove everything inside of the function and write 'return handler(*args)' instead.

## Running the project locally

1. cd into the 'server' folder and run 'python wsgi.py'. This will spin up the Gunicorn WSGI server (you can configure the server in the wsgi.py file).
2. go to the 'package.json' file in the 'client' folder and add a proxy that points to the URL of the WSGI server (http://{IP Address}:{PORT}).
3. run the command 'npm start' in the 'client' folder and open the app in any browser.
